# Mendio Landing Page
In this project, I have created a simple landing page for a adoption service. The design was sketched on Figma, and then developed on HTML/CSS.
I implemented Javascript to fetch data from an Api Dictionary. The functionality is similar to a search engine. 
The page is not currently mobile responsive due to time constraints, so it is best used on a laptop or desktop machine.
